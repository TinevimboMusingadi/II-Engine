## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

### **Project Title:**
"Intelligent Insurance Engine: AI-Powered Multimodal Claims Processing for Zimbabwe"

### **Problem Statement:**
Insurance claim processing in Zimbabwe takes weeks or months due to manual document review, lack of digital infrastructure, and complex verification processes. This creates financial hardship for customers and operational inefficiency for insurers, particularly affecting rural communities with limited access to traditional banking and insurance services.

### **Impact Statement:**
Our AI-powered multimodal insurance engine reduces processing time from weeks to minutes (95% time reduction), enables 24/7 automated processing, and provides accessible insurance services to underserved communities. The system processes structured customer data, vehicle images, and insurance documents simultaneously using BigQuery's multimodal capabilities, delivering immediate premium quotes and claim decisions.
